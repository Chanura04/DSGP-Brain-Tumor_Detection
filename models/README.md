# MODELS FOLDER

### Purpose:
Stores all trained models and checkpoints.

### Typical Files:
- *.pt, *.bin, *.pkl, *.h5 : Saved model weights.
- checkpoint_* : Training checkpoints.
- model_card.txt : Optional model details (model_card.md).
- trained artifacts

### Notes:
- Large models should be ignored from version control.
- If using DVC : store pointers, not actual files.
